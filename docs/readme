flights are stored with spaces so need to keep that in mind when searching

database improvements
  save flight num without spaces
  save all data from the api
    were missing international/departure for filtering
  consistent naming between tables
  scraped at time is in utc and updated time in the api is pkt so need to make all same
  scraping needs to be
    consistent
    more frequent closer to flights
  flights that have terminated like departed, arrived, cancelled or those that are no longer in the database should be marked as no more checking needed
